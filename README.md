# DailyTents
This project was made as an assignment for Clean Coding course. I worked alone in this project.

## Rules / Objectives Summary

Find all of the hidden tents.
Each tent is attached to one tree (so there are as many tents as there are trees).
The numbers across the top and down the side tell you how many tents are in the respective row or column.
A tent can only be found horizontally or vertically adjacent to a tree.
Tents are never adjacent to each other, neither vertically, horizontally, nor diagonally.
A tree might be next to two tents, but is only connected to one.
